t# Milestone Project Three: Greatreads

## User Experience (UX)
### User Stories:
*  Registered Users
1. I would like to browse for new books to read published by other users.
2. I would like to see reviews for books so that I can see how good a book is.
3. I should be able to sign in, sign out and sign up.
4. Should be able to add new books with all relevant information.
5. I should be able to access all relevant pages.

*  Unregistered Users
1. I should be able to view books without signing up.
2. I should be able to sign up to the site.

* Admin 
1. Should be able to access all pages
2. Should be allowed to change the weekly featured book.
3. Should be able to add a book.
4. Should be able to add review.
### Design:
* Colour
I used an orange and white theme that I got inspiration from [Colormind](http://colormind.io/).

* Imagery
I used a simple repeating book background image for the background as I believe it gives the website a carefree feeling. [BG-Image](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQoQe3X1GiBNygPMihib5H3skpyTrBJLadBWEx5mkFZjbNHzRkdxQN8qXDa0LkESa-hctc&usqp=CAU)

## Technologies Used
### Languages Used:
* CSS3
* HTML5
* Python
### Libraries, Frameworks and Programs:
1.  Materialize
*  Used for styling, main components used were cards and the grid system.
2.  Jquery
*  Used for the nav.
3.  Font Awesome
*  Used to add icons to guide the users eyes appropriately.
4.  Github
*  Used for version control and for repositories.
5.  Gitpod
*  IDE used to create the site.
6.  Balsamiq
*  Used for planning of the project.
## Testing
*  Chrome Dev tools were constantly used to test the site and its responsiveness, also other web browsers were tested with the site.
*  Tested all links and buttons to ensure they were all connected appropriately.
*  Had family and friends test my site and give feedback to what I can improve.
## Bugs that Need Fixing
*  A bug that needs fixing is that reviews show on all books instead of a specific one. I could not figure out the logic for this and will enquire with peers in the future to fix the problem.
## Credits
### Code:
*  Code was used from the Materialize framework to create the style of pages.
*  Code was used from the Code Institute Task Manager Mini Project to set up some of the log in/sign up functionality.
